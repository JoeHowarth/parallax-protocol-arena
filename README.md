# Parallax Paradox: Arena

Arena is the first milestone in the Parallax Protocol project, focusing on tactical space combat with innovative timeline manipulation mechanics. It serves as both a standalone competitive game and a foundation for the broader vision of Parallax Protocol.

## The Vision

In Arena, two commanders engage in tactical space combat where superior planning and resource management determine victory. While the full Parallax Protocol will explore strategic command across the solar system under realistic light-speed constraints, Arena zooms in on the tactical core of ship-to-ship combat in a confined region of space.

## Core Mechanics

### Timeline Manipulation
Combat in Arena revolves around a unique timeline system that lets commanders slow time to plan elaborate maneuvers. This creates a dynamic blend of real-time action and tactical planning, where players can:
- Plot complex multi-ship movements
- Coordinate precise timing of abilities
- React to and counter opponent strategies
- Chain together sophisticated maneuvers

### Energy Management
Each ship operates as a "glass cannon," making positioning and energy management critical for survival. Commanders must balance:
- Engine power for mobility
- Elastic beam deployment for advanced maneuvers
- Point defense systems for protection
- Energy regeneration timing

### Advanced Movement
The signature Elastic Beam system enables creative movement tactics:
- Create slingshot maneuvers around asteroids
- Execute rapid direction changes
- Establish dynamic anchor points
- Set up intricate multi-ship formations

### Tactical Environment
Dense and sparse asteroid fields create varied tactical scenarios:
- Use cover for ambush opportunities
- Control sight lines for strategic advantage
- Navigate complex paths for flanking
- Deny opponent information through careful positioning

## Looking Forward

Arena represents the tactical foundation of Parallax Protocol. Future iterations will expand beyond the confined arena to encompass:
- Strategic command across the solar system
- Light-speed communication constraints
- Economic and resource management
- Fleet coordination and logistics
- Semi-autonomous ship operations

By focusing first on perfecting the core combat experience, Arena ensures that the foundation of Parallax Protocol delivers engaging and sophisticated gameplay that rewards both quick thinking and careful planning.

## Development Status

This project is actively under development. Follow along for updates as we work towards our first playable release.
