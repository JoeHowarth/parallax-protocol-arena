# Parallax Paradox: Arena

Arena is the first milestone in the Parallax Protocol project, featuring intense 2-player space combat where skill, creativity, and tactical planning determine victory. It serves as both a compelling competitive game and a foundation for our broader vision: commanding vast networks of ships and resources across the solar system under realistic light-speed communication constraints.

## The Vision
Arena strips space combat down to its competitive essence. 
No tech trees, no grind - just two commanders in a dance of position and momentum. 
Arena rewards creative tactical thinking and mechanical mastery, creating matches where every movement matters and victory comes from outwitting, not outgunning, your opponent.

## Core Mechanics

### Movement and Combat
At the heart of Arena is the Elastic Beam system, enabling movementum-conserving control over spacecraft movement. Commanders can create slingshot maneuvers around asteroids, establish dynamic anchor points, and chain together complex orbital patterns. This system transforms traditional space combat by making terrain interaction and creative movement central to success.

Ships are designed as "glass cannons" with powerful offensive capabilities but requiring skillful piloting to survive. Point defense systems create dynamic zones of control, while the threat of concentrated fire keeps commanders thinking about positioning and approach angles.

### Tactical Depth Through Time Control
Arena's core timeline visualization and input system lets commanders slow time to plan elaborate strategies without fully pausing the action. This creates a unique rhythm where intense real-time combat is punctuated by moments of tactical decision-making. Success comes not from statistical advantages but from reading your opponent, setting up clever combinations, and executing complex maneuvers with precision.

### Dynamic Battlefields
Asteroid fields aren't just obstacles - they're opportunities for tactical creativity:
- Create surprising attack angles using terrain-assisted movement
- Control sight lines while maintaining mobility options
- Set up ambush positions using natural cover
- Deny opponent information through careful positioning

Every engagement becomes a dynamic puzzle where movement, timing, and positioning must be carefully considered. The environment itself becomes a tool in skilled hands.

## Looking Forward

Arena represents the tactical foundation of a much broader vision: 
commanding a vast network of spacecraft and operations across the entire solar system. 
While Arena focuses on perfecting close-range combat mechanics, 
future expansions will introduce revolutionary strategic depth through several key systems:

### Light-Speed Command Delays
The fundamental constraint of light-speed communication creates a novel strategic layer where 
command latency becomes a vital consideration. 
Orders to ships near Jupiter can take up to 52 minutes to arrive, 
forcing players to carefully consider:

- Command center positioning to minimize critical response times
- Forward command posts to maintain tactical control in distant regions
- Information warfare as sensor data and orders propagate at light speed

### Autonomous Operations
At greater distances, direct control becomes impractical. Players develop a hierarchy of autonomous behaviors:

- Local reactive behaviors for individual ships and stations
- Regional coordinators managing fleets and resources
- Strategic commanders overseeing entire zones
- Players can write hot-reloaded custom behaviors using the same tools as the game's developers, allowing for sophisticated autonomous strategies.

### Strategic Layer
The interplay of light-speed delays and autonomous operations creates compelling strategic choices:

- Designing robust operations that function across vast distances and delays
- Balancing centralized control against local autonomy
- Managing industrial operations and supply lines that span the solar system
- Building hierarchical command structures to coordinate distant regions

By focusing first on Arena's tactical excellence, we ensure these strategic elements emerge naturally from a foundation of precise, engaging mechanics. Players progress from mastering individual ship combat to orchestrating vast operations - from direct tactical control to strategic command, from manual piloting to programming sophisticated autonomous behaviors. Through this progression, the core theme remains constant: success comes not from statistical advantages, but from superior strategy, careful planning, and elegant solutions to the fundamental challenges of space warfare.


## Development Status

The project is currenly working towards a technical demo of arena with minimal graphics. This is the second demo after validating the integration of hot-reloaded lua scripting for agent behaviors. Expect arena to focus on rust foundamentals first.

If you have ideas or questions the team would love to hear your thoughts! Issues are the best place for now, though we'll get a discord going once we're ready to share an alpha.

Later in the development process we're looking for artists and graphics engineers, both volunteer and paid contract roles.
